# Reversi_Player
Algorithms for reversi/othello. One deterministic and one using Monte Carlo simulations.
The algorithm uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in a simplified form. The Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the value of a move by simulating random future plays and determining which move has the best expected outcome based on random sampling.
